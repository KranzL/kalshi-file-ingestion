The Underlying for the market is Executive Orders issued by the President and bills that have become law. If broad-based student debt forgiveness is enacted through other means that are not the above two (such as a presidential memo, or rule-making by the Department of Education without an executive order or bill), then that would not be encompassed in the Payout Criterion and the market would remain open until its latest possible Expiration Date, in January 2023, and resolve to No. Kalshi always will resolve markets based on its rules.
