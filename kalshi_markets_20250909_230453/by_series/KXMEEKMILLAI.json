The market will resolve Yes if any company that Meek Mill owns (whether a majority or minority equity stake in a private or directly-controlled company) commercially releases to the public an artificial intelligence tool or AI-powered feature before January 1, 2026. Passive investments such as holding stock in public companies (e.g., owning shares of Nvidia) do not qualify as ownership. A qualifying release must meet the Exchange\u2019s definition of \u201ccommercial release\u201d: the product is available for purchase, subscription, or download by the general public through official company channels, authorized retailers, or platform stores, and is not explicitly labeled as beta, early access, preview, prototype, or test. Ownership is established if Meek Mill has a direct equity stake in the company itself, verified through official company statements, corporate filings, or credible press reports from listed Source Agencies; endorsements, partnerships, or sponsorships without equity ownership do not qualify. Internal-only tools, announcements without public access, or purely promotional campaigns do not count. If at least one such company verifiably releases an AI product meeting these conditions before the deadline, the market resolves Yes; otherwise, it resolves No.", "early_close_condition": "This market will close and expire early if the event occurs.", "tick_size": 1}]}
