A multi-episode docuseries does not qualify unless it is officially packaged and released as a single documentary film. To meet the involvement requirement, Taylor Swift must be officially credited as Director, Writer, or Producer, or the project must be publicly and explicitly announced as approved by her through official channels such as her verified social media, her official website, or a press release from her representatives. Credit as an Executive Producer qualifies only if Swift is named directly, while general participation, such as appearing as an interview subject, does not meet the criterion. Concert films qualify only if they are explicitly described as a \u201cdocumentary\u201d by official sources. Projects featuring Taylor Swift alongside other artists qualify only if Swift is a central subject and the project is branded as a Taylor Swift documentary. Any official announcement, whether domestic or international, counts as long as it can be verified through approved sources. Re-releases of old projects or director\u2019s cuts of previously released Swift documentaries do not qualify.", "tick_size": 1}]}
