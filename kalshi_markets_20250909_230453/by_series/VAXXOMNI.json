For example, upgrading an emergency use authorization approved before the existence of Omicron to a full authorization without modification would not result in the contract resolving to Yes, even if that vaccine does protect against variants including Omicron, as that vaccine is neither \"distributed specifically to target the Omicron variant\" nor \"distributed to target variants including the Omicron variant\".", "tick_size": 1}]}
